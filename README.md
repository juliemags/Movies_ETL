# Movies_ETL

## Overview
The goal of this project was to clean data using a process of Extracting, transforming, and loading the data. We want to be able to easily read the data without having to do too much individual data cleaning (and more transformations of data). 

## Results

We were able to clean all of the data, removing columns and data points to be able to pull the information necessary. We worked across Jupyter notebook, Python, and SQL to find all fo thsi information.
